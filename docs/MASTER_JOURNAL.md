# Local context journal

Role: Controlled repository-local handoff journal for OOS Context Protocol v0.1. The canonical portfolio MJ and authoritative project journals remain separately located in `docs/INDEX.json`.

This reusable template contains no reconstructed historical events. Append verified observations and changes using the event format in [Governance](GOVERNANCE.md); preserve recording time separately from event time. Recovering a reference to an artifact is not recovering its payload.

## CTX-20260908-001 — OOS context package integrity verified
Summary: Added or integrated standardized context documents, a machine-readable index and validation. This event verifies the local context change; it makes no application/deployment or full-history recovery claim.
Sources: aoblak/ai-agent-web@ea91e40ba2b5693cda617283a6a3852801cb9b8a; accepted OOS governance glossary@a165ad489a34c8def8f8bd819d4fa35d3bec0d88; scripts/oos_context.py; tests/test_oos_context.py.
Integrity: PASS — required files and journal locators checked by scripts/oos_context.py; hashes regenerated and read back.
Independent: PASS — accepted governance read at the recorded source revision; target file paths checked against its Git tree.
Adverse: PASS — 16 regression checks cover lost files, stale hashes, private/public labels, ambiguous events, symlinks and conflicting writer locks.
Rollback: Revert this context change as a Git commit; preserve unrelated commits and earlier journal history.
Next: Verify repository branch/merge state before reporting adoption; application and deployment status remain independently verified facts.
